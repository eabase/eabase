...and then there were mushrooms. :mushroom:

### Scientist, Ex-Broker and Trader
Navigating the rough seas intersecting ethics, finance and overly intelligent  
technology, all while dodging the monsters in the dark depths of ignorance.

### Developer - not so much, but
- Made MT4/5 EA's, Indicator's, Scripts's and trading robots 
- Built a lot of other things...

### Things I do and use, that will bore most
- Process automation and optimization
- For Pleasure: Python, NodeJS, JavaScript, 
- For Stat: MatLab, Octave, R
- For Self-Torture: C++, C#, Java
- Sometimes: ARM Assembly / Machine Code, Perl, Ruby, Go
- Embedded Hardware Design
- Reverse Engineer soft & hard *things*...

### Things that waste my time (*but saves your life*)
- Converting Powershell cmdlets into Bash 
- Convert any long Windows cmd/pwsh junk into one-liners
- Constantly bothering ~~Windows~~ all developers to fix this or that and update their repo documentation

### An occupational hazard of diverse interests
- Machine Learning in Applied Finance
- Deep Deep Trancendant Learning 
- Applied AI/ML/DL for Trading automation 
- Open socialized Hedge Fund management
- High Frequency Trading (HFT)
- High Performance Parallel Computing (HPPC)
- Computational Simulation 
- Extremely Low Latency Systems
